## Assymptotic Notations

- To get an idea of notations like Big-Oh, Omega and Theta, it is recommended to [watch this video, by Abdul Bari](https://youtu.be/A03oI0znAoc).

## Finding the time complexity

- You should be able to find out the time complexity of a given code snippet. You can [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TlHvipP5yA) for this.

## Checking whether your solution will pass the time limits

- Go through [this tutorial on hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/basic-programming/complexity-analysis/time-and-space-complexity/tutorial/). You must be able to find out, if your solution is fast enough, to pass the time limit constraints.

:::tip

Approximately, 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> operations are performed in 1 second. Always use this information, to estimate whether your solution will be able to pass the time limits, before writing any code.
