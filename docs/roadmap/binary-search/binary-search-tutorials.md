## Binary search

1. Watch [Binary search video by Errichto](https://youtu.be/GU7DpgHINWQ)
2. Read [Top Coder article for Binary search](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/binary-search/)

## Ternary search

1. Read [CP-algorithms article on ternary search](https://cp-algorithms.com/num_methods/ternary_search.html)
2. Read [Hackerearth article on ternary search](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/ternary-search/tutorial/)

:::tip

**Note**: Ternary search problems can also be solved using binary search, by considering the function ```g(x) = f(x) > f(x-1)``` as a monotonic function. See [this blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/11497) for more details.
